This is a university-level assignment that I have completed.

Objectives The main objectives of this assignment are:

   •To work with events and delegates using a publisher/subscriber pattern
   
   • To create a WPF application and become acquainted with some basic WPF component

Description: 

   We are going to simulate a simple use case of flight departures in an airport.
    The airport has a control tower.A controller registers a plane to get ready on the runway and
    to take off using a software with a UI that may be designed as illustrated in the figure below.
    The top ListBox lists the planes added in a list of airplanes handled by the Control Tower while
    the lower ListBox is used to display the flight status and other information.The user selects
    an airplane in the top ListBox before clicking the Take Of
    After taking off, the airplane(monitored by its pilot, of course) notifies the same control tower
    when taking off is complete and when the plane has landed.
